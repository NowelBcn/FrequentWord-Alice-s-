# Practice 1: Web scraping

## Description
<p>In this notebook, I scrape the novel <em>Alice's adventures in Wonderland</em> from the website <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>. Then I'll extract words from this web data using <code>BeautifulSoup</code> and <code>Requests packages</code>. Finally, I'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (<code>nltk</code>). </p>

## Team members
The activity has been carried out individually by Noel Gallego Alarc√≥n
